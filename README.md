* **What are its subunits? Gwei and Wei**

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wei.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wei.asp)

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gwei-ethereum.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gwei-ethereum.asp)

Gas prices are denoted in gwei
More on gas, gas price, gas limit :
[https://www.zastrin.com/courses/ethereum-primer/lessons/2-6](https://www.zastrin.com/courses/ethereum-primer/lessons/2-6)

Block gas limit: Block gas limit is the maximum cap applied to each block in Ethereum. Currently, a block can only include transactions whose total sum of gas is less than 8 million. The reason you have a limit for each block is to prevent someone from just writing an infinite loop in which case the transaction wouldn't complete it's execution resulting in block not getting mined.

* **How does consensus work on Ethereum?**

### Block on Ethereum

* **What is a block on ethereum?**

[https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/blocks/#:~:text=Blocks%20are%20batches%20of%20transactions,derived%20from%20the%20block%20data.](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/blocks/#:~:text=Blocks%20are%20batches%20of%20transactions,derived%20from%20the%20block%20data)

* **How do you see the transactions in a block?**

By using black explorers like etherscan.

70 transactions in a block, number of transactions that can be fitted in a block depend on the gas.

* **What are Block Explorers?**

Online tool to view all transactions that have taken place on the blockchain

### Anatomy of a Transaction

* **What is EVM?**

[https://medium.com/mycrypto/the-ethereum-virtual-machine-how-does-it-work-9abac2b7c9e](https://medium.com/mycrypto/the-ethereum-virtual-machine-how-does-it-work-9abac2b7c9e)

* **What is gas and gas price?**

[https://www.zastrin.com/courses/ethereum-primer/lessons/2-6](https://www.zastrin.com/courses/ethereum-primer/lessons/2-6)

* **How do you check the latest gas price?**

On Ethereum you check it using [https://ethgasstation.info/](https://ethgasstation.info/)

* **How are the gas price and the network traffic related and why?**

When the traffic is more the lower gas priced transactions will take longer to execute so in order to  complete the  transaction faster when the when traffic is high, gas price needs to be high to complete a transaction in time

* **Where does your code run? Can it be changed/taken down?**

On collection of nodes. They can’t be changed, since they are immutable.

* **Understanding that there is one ethereum mainnet (the main blockchain) and then there are multiple testnets (test blockchains) with fake ether so that developers can test their code before going to the mainnet**
